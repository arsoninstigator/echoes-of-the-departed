# echoes of the departed ⚰️♱

this repository is just essentially me documenting my contributions for our game for juice / jungle :D

our game is a pixel art based narrative-exploration game where cleaning tombstones reveals the untold stories of the dead. our protagonist is the <ins>caretaker of an abandoned graveyard</ins> where the caretaker cleans headstones, polish graves, and ensures that the dead of the graveyard are resting peacefully under their care. each time they clean a grave, they <ins>gain a window into the life of the one buried beneath</ins>—witnessing their joys, their struggles, and their final moments. 

the player can interact with the storyline that's being narrated as a five-minute preview into the life of the person whose graveyard they picked as we flip through a journal filled with doodles documenting their life (from the perspective of an invisible 3rd person). the player can : 
- clean graves to unlock visual memories of the deceased.
- judge souls by honoring or condemning their graves.

we're using <ins>godot</ins> as the game engine and the game is an interactive <ins>mixture of 2d and 3d elements</ins>, namely 3d model tilesets (with the license to use them, of course), self-made and hand-drawn pixel art (made using aseprite or ibispaintx) and simple doodles (made on procreate). my personal contributions were in the area of <ins>making game assets/graphics/textures</ins>, <ins>storylining</ins> and <ins>making music</ins> include game soundtracks to support the game environment and go along with game graphics and gameplay mechanics.

while at the current stage the game is far from done and we're still not 100% sure about the direction in which it is headed, you can find the [itch.io game link here](https://vedant235.itch.io/echoes-of-the-departed) for a quick preview.

**note:** i've given up on meeting the 100h criteria for juice because even though the prospect of going to china was exciting at first, i've realized it's not worth being put at the risk, especially since hc won't be covering travel entirely (the stipend is 250$ and flights would be at least 700$) and i'd have to pay out of pocket (which i cannot do since i cannot afford it). the only way to gain more $ is to work even more hours on top of the 100h to accumulate the stipend and i just ... no offense ... don't think spending 300h (or even 100h) on this is worth it
